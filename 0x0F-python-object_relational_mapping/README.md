#### This is the documentation we all need.
##This is a documentation for Mysqldb and Orm of a project for github. Mysqldb is a Python interface for MySQL, a relational database management system. Orm is an object-relational mapper, a tool that maps Python objects to database tables and vice versa. The project uses Mysqldb and Orm to create, read, update and delete data from a MySQL database.

This is a documentation for a project that involves creating and querying a states table in a MySQL database using Python. The project consists of two files: 0-select_states.sql and 0-select_states.py.

The file 0-select_states.sql contains the SQL commands to create the database hbtn_0e_0_usa, use it, create the states table, and insert some data into it. The states table has two columns: id and name. The id column is an integer that is auto-incremented and serves as the primary key. The name column is a variable-length string that cannot be null. The SQL commands are executed in the order they appear in the file.

The file 0-select_states.py contains the Python code to connect to the MySQL database using the MySQLdb module and the arguments passed to the script. The arguments are the username, password, and database name. The script then creates a cursor object and executes a query to select all the rows from the states table, ordered by id in ascending order. The script fetches all the results from the query and prints them in a loop. Finally, the script closes the cursor and the connection objects.
