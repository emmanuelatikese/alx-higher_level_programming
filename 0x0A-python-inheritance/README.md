##Introduction
This project delves into the application of inheritance in Python, a foundational concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). Inheritance enables the creation of new classes by inheriting attributes and behaviors from existing ones.The project comprises various Python scripts that illustrate the practical implementation of inheritance in Python. Each script features a class hierarchy where the subclass extends the capabilities of the superclass by introducing additional functionalities.
