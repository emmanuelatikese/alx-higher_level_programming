# This is a summary of the tasks and files in this project.

# The project involves creating a Python class Square that defines a square object.
# The class has the following features:

# - A private instance attribute size that represents the length of a side of the square.
# - A property size to get and set the value of size, with type and value validation.
# - A public instance method area that returns the area of the square.
# - A public instance method my_print that prints the square using the character #, or an empty line if size is 0.
# - A private instance attribute position that represents the position of the top-left corner of the square relative to (0, 0).
# - A property position to get and set the value of position, with type and value validation.
# - An optional parameter position in the __init__ method to initialize the position of the square.

# The files in this project are:

# - tests: A folder of test files provided by Holberton School.
# - 0-square.py: The first version of the Square class, with only the size attribute and __init__ method.
# - 1-square.py: The second version of the Square class, with the property size added.
# - 2-square.py: The third version of the Square class, with type and value validation for size in the __init__ method.
# - 3-square.py: The fourth version of the Square class, with the area method added.
# - 4-square.py: The fifth version of the Square class, with type and value validation for size in the property setter.
# - 5-square.py: The sixth version of the Square class, with the my_print method added.
# - 6-square.py: The seventh version of the Square class, with the position attribute, property and parameter added, and the my_print method modified to account for position.
